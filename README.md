# series-score-overlay
**WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

Stream scoreboard overlay to track a games series. Currently the only officially supported game is Rocket League with Bo1-9 modes.

## todo
* Check support for other resolutions.
* Add global keybinds for changing score.
* Add support for other games:
  - Valorant
  - League of Legends
  - Smash Ultimate
  - NBA2k
  - FIFA
* Add ability to change the background for more chromakey compatability.
* Make it so the window can be resized dynamically?? (this might be problematic though)
* ~~Change overlay design to something better~~ (kind of finished, but could always be better)

## running the app
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/kmattix/series-score-overlay/releases) and select the most recent `Tag`, then follow the `Setup` steps.
